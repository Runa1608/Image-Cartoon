# Image-Cartoon
Developed an Image Cartoonifier application using Python, Tkinter, OpenCV, and PIL to convert images and webcam 
captures from personal computers into cartoon-style visuals.
Implemented features like undo/redo functionality, image transformations (translation, rotation, scaling), and color 
adjustments.
Added face detection, image filters (grayscale, sepia, edge detection), and texture modifications (blur, sharpen).
Enabled image upload, processing, and save options with seamless user interaction through a GUI
